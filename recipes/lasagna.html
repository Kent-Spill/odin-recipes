        <li>1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 no-boil lasagna noodles (about 9 oz.)</li>
        <li>1 lb. whole-milk mozzarella, shredded</li>
        <li>3 c. finely grated Parmesan (about 7 oz.)</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook beef and pork, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add marinara sauce and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then stir in 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded, about 20 minutes; season with remaining 1 teaspoon salt, if needed.</li>
        <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, heat milk until warm to the touch but not boiling.</li>
        <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add flour and cook, whisking frequently, until light tan in color and texture resembles wet sand, about 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, very slowly add milk until combined. Increase heat to high and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pass spoon through edges of pot to collect any butter-flour mixture that wasn’t fully incorporated and mix to combine. Stir in nutmeg; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°. In a deep 13"-by-9" ceramic, glass, or metal baking dish, spread 1 1/2 cups Bolognese, followed by 3 pasta sheets and 3/4 cup béchamel. Sprinkle with about one-fifth of mozzarella and Parmesan. Repeat to make 5 layers, finishing with cheese.</li>
        <li>Spray a sheet of foil with cooking spray. Cover dish oiled side down.</li>
        <li>Bake lasagna 20 minutes, then increase oven temperature to 400°. Uncover and continue to bake until sides are bubbling and darkened and cheese starts to turn golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn broiler to medium. Broil lasagna, watching closely, until top is toasted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Let cool 15 minutes. Top with parsley and serve.</li>
   </ol>
